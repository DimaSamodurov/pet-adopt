## A few rules how to master styles

- Use frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation.
- Do not put css into html, unless this way is designed from the beginning.
- Try to reuse existing styles (functions/variables/constants) where possible, 
do not introduce new structures without a need. 
This because simplicity = effectiveness. 
Learning more new things is complex, maintaining more things is complex. 
- If you decide to create a new style, make it reusable!
  - Prefer generic names with semantic meaning
  - Use variables
  - Keep configuration separately 
  - Consider generating style guide:
